# hangboard
Hangboard Timer is a cross-platform mobile app for rock climbers doing workouts on a Hangboard/Fingerboard device.  The app offers 4 workouts plans, a timer, and historical performance tracking.

# what is a fingerboard?
Rock climbers use fingerboards to build strength in their fingers, hands, and forearms.  I use a board from Metolius, which can be seen here: https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/project-board.html

The board gets mounted somewhere high (above a door in my basement) and then the climber performs a variety of exercises (exercises link: https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/training_more_exercises.html).

The exercises are performed on a schedule over 10 minutes.  Here is a few sample exercise plans: https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/training_guide_10_min.html

# why Hangboard Timer?
Because I want to plan and track my workouts more easily!!!  I got tired of having paper, pencil, and my phone for a timer when trying to get my workout completed.  Especially because the hangboard is mounted over a doorway there is no convenient way to place all these items in an accessible, readable way.  So, this app is intended to simplify the whole setup.

The app will run on a tablet in landscape orientation typically.  The table will be hung below the fingerboard for easiest visibility.  The UI is simple with very large buttons because chalky hands don't tend to interact well with small controls.
